card_description = "Berlin has a lot of hidden history. Sometimes there are still noticeable traces of it today, but other times nothing is left. The 'What happened here' app aims to bridge the gap between the past and the present and make history visible again. With its location based notification feature, you can walk through Berlin and get notified if you are walking past a point with a historic background and learn about it via the app. Information about cultural, historical and social issues can be gathered in our WH2 Editor by different institutions in multiple languages."

{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Through our project we and our cooperation partners want to provide our users access to important cultural, historical and social issues. With functionalities like location based notifucations, share options and personalized area of interests, it is possible to explore the city through topics one is really interested in. We don't want to limit ourselves to Berlin, but educate people everywhere in every language.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
The WH2 team consists of 4 students with experience in web and app development, even though this tech stack was new to everybody. One team member was mainly responsible for the backend, one for the app and two for the editor. But in general everyone helped in all areas.
